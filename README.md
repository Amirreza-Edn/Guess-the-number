# Guess-the-number

Here is a Python program that generates a random number between 0 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number.
The program provides hints by telling the user if their guess was higher or lower than the number after each guess they make. 
The number of attempts and the time will be recorded and printed by the program.
The user also has the option to exit the game before guessing the number.

Requirements:

Python 3 installed.

How to use:

	1	The user enters a number between 0-100 as asked by the game.
	2	If the user guesses the number correctly, the program will display the number of attempts and the time it took to guess the number.
	3	The user could use the key “q” to quit the game. If so, the program will display the time it took to play the game.
	4	The user can play the game again by running the program again.
